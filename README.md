# Restaurant-Inspection-Analysis
##Introduction
The project was an analysis of San Fransisco Restaurant inspection Data using Python code and Plotly Dash to diplay the dashboard. 
The inspiration behind the project was from my favorite restaurants on Yelp. When I found the Health Department developed an inspection 
report and scoring system on restaurants, I was curious to see what lied within the data. These inspections were unscheduled. After an 
inspection of the facility, the Health Inspector calculates a score based on the violations observed. Violations fell into high, moderate, 
and low risk categories. High risk category records specific violations that directly relate to the transmission of food-borne illnesses, 
the adulteration of food products and the contamination of food-contact surfaces. Moderate risk category records specific violations that 
are of a moderate risk to the public health and safety Low risk category records violations that are low risk or have no immediate risk to 
the public health and safety. Once a score is given, the score card will be issued by the inspector and is maintained at the food establishment, 
available to the public in this dataset. The analysis revealed that even a high risk category restaurant could score high for their inspection score. 
The risk caegory are not visible but should be for patrons. 

Python and Plotly Dash was used in the analysis.
